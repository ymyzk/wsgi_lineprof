**wsgi_lineprof** is a WSGI middleware for line-by-line profiling.

wsgi_lineprof has the following features:

* *WSGI middleware*: It can be integrated with any WSGI-compatible applications and frameworks including Django, Pyramid, Flask, Bottle, and more.
* *Easily pluggable*: All configurations for profiling in one place. Users don't need to make any changes to their application.

wsgi_lineprof is *not recommended to be used in production environment* because of the overhead of profiling.
